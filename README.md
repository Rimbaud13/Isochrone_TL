# Isochrone_TL

This was done for the cs108 EPFL class in collaboration with user JBouron.


Unfortunately the timetable data for the TL is licensed and we therefore can't upload it here.
http://gtfs.geops.ch can be used to retrieve the data, we did not try.

Here are some screen captures to see it fully work.
